# Distributed Assets

Distributed Assets are at the core of data movement and mapping for display in Data Applications. Define your
Enterprise's assets and then map the flow of data between your Enterprise architecture to establish a real time
mechanism for data movement.

## Getting Started with Distributed Assets

There are many various forms your Asset definition can take. From fairly static reference data to
always-calculated marts, the Distributed Assets system provides a simple interface for retrieving and
delivering data to your end users.
